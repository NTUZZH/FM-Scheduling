"""Crew-tightness transform for the contention regimes (E3 / Gate B amendment).

``scale_crew(instance, m)`` returns a DEEP COPY of ``instance`` whose per-trade
technician count is scaled by ``m`` (``max(1, round(count * m))``), keeping every
work order untouched.  This turns any workload -- replay or generator -- into a
more (m < 1) or less (m > 1) capacity-contended variant, which is what makes the
dynamic dispatch problem discriminative (docs/decision_log.md 2026-07-05, Gate B
protocol amendment: contended regimes use crew_multiplier in {0.6, 0.8}).

The copy's ``meta.crew_multiplier`` records ``m`` and its ``meta.id`` is suffixed
``_m<m>`` so scaled instances never collide with the originals in an index or a
results shard.  Technicians are renumbered ``T0..`` grouped by sorted trade so the
result is deterministic and self-consistent regardless of the source ids.
