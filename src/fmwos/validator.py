"""Independent feasibility validator for the FM work-order scheduling benchmark.

This module is the *referee*. It is deliberately self-contained: it shares no
code with the environment/solvers/io modules in ``fmwos`` and depends only on
the Python standard library and numpy. It re-derives every rule from the
authoritative interface spec so a bug in the benchmark plumbing
cannot silently launder an infeasible schedule into a "valid" one.

Public API

CLI

python -m fmwos.validator <instance.json> <schedule.json>
    prints the result dict as JSON to stdout; exit 0 iff feasible else 1.
