"""Admissible lower bound on remaining weighted tardiness (P3 reward shaping).

This module is a *pure* function used by ``fmwos.env`` to build the
potential-shaped reward (see the training spec §2).  It
conditions ONLY on the currently-queued jobs and the current technician
availabilities (future arrivals are ignored -- that is what keeps the bound
admissible for the realized online episode, since arrivals can only add cost).

----------
``lb_remaining(queues, tech_busy_until, t) -> float``
    queues            : dict  trade -> list of (p, d, w) for queued jobs
    tech_busy_until   : dict  trade -> list of per-technician availability times
                        (the bh time each tech next becomes free; a currently
                        idle tech's value may be <= t and is clamped to t)
    t                 : float current bh time
Returns the summed per-trade lower bound (trades are independent -- separate
technician pools -- so the sum of admissible per-trade bounds is admissible).

Two per-trade bounds are taken and their max is used (both are valid lower
bounds, so the larger is too):

  (i)  per-job earliest-completion bound
         sum_j w_j * max(0, tau_min + p_j - d_j),  tau_min = min_i max(t, tau_i)
       C_j >= tau_min + p_j in any schedule, so each term lower-bounds w_j T_j
       and the sum lower-bounds sum_j w_j T_j.

  (ii) capacity-overflow bound (corrected, admissible form)
       Sort the queued jobs by due date.  For each distinct due d let
         D(d)   = sum_{j: d_j <= d} p_j                     (work due by d)
         cap(d) = sum_i max(0, d - max(t, tau_i))           (machine-time by d)
         O(d)   = max(0, D(d) - cap(d))                     (overflow work-hours)
       The overflow work necessarily finishes after d; the fluid "area" argument
       gives  sum_{j: d_j<=d} p_j * (C_j - d)^+  >=  O(d)^2 / (2 k).  Converting
       from this work-weighted area to the objective sum_j w_j (C_j - d_j)^+
       costs a factor rho_min = min_{j: d_j<=d} (w_j / p_j) (cheapest weight per
       unit work among the jobs due by d), so the admissible contribution is
         rho_min * O(d)^2 / (2 k).
       (NOTE: the P3 spec wrote this constant as ``w_min`` -- the cheapest queued
       *weight*.  That form bounds the fluid area itself, not the per-job
       objective, and OVER-estimates it whenever a job is large -- e.g. one job
       p=10, d=5, k=1 gives w_min*O^2/2k = 12.5 but the true tardiness is 5 --
       so it is NOT admissible.  ``rho_min = min w_j/p_j`` is the correct,
       provably-admissible constant; see docs/decision_log.md.)

The max of (i) and (ii) is the per-trade bound; trades are summed.
