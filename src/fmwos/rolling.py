"""Rolling-horizon CP-SAT policy for dynamic dispatch episodes (E2 baseline).

This is the dynamic-track counterpart of the static ``fmwos.cpsat`` solver: it
runs ONE instance as an online episode (work orders hidden until ``release_bh``)
and, on every arrival event, re-solves a *static snapshot* of the currently
released-but-unstarted jobs, then executes the resulting incumbent until the next
arrival.  It is the strong "solver that may insert idle time" baseline the
dispatching rules (``fmwos.pdrs``) and the learned policy are measured against
(the interface spec, "Dynamic rolling track"; the training spec §1).

Protocol (spec-locked)
----------------------
* Replan trigger: new arrival(s).  Arrivals within ``BATCH_BH`` (0.1 bh) of the
  first arrival of a batch are folded into ONE replan (a bounded number of
  simultaneous / near-simultaneous releases -> one solve).
* Snapshot model: the released-and-unstarted jobs (the queue); technicians are
  available from their ``busy_until`` time (a tech running an in-progress job is
  unavailable until it finishes -- in-progress jobs are FIXED, never re-solved).
  The snapshot is expressed in a frame shifted so the replan instant is 0, so all
  queued jobs have release ``max(0, r_j - t)`` and due ``d_j - t``; technician
  availability ``max(0, busy_until - t)`` is passed to ``cpsat.solve`` via its
  ``tech_available`` hook (a dummy [0, a_u) interval per busy tech).
* Budget: ``budget_s`` (default 2.0 s) wall per replan, ``workers=2``,
  warm-started from the current incumbent mapped into the shifted frame (a hint,
  never a constraint).
* Execution between replans: each technician follows its incumbent's job ORDER;
  when a technician becomes free it starts its next incumbent job, and it may
  deliberately IDLE until that job's incumbent start time (the advantage over a
  non-delay rule).  Solves are synchronous (simulated time is frozen during the
  solve), so no job can arrive mid-solve; the only way a queued job could be
  missing from the incumbent is a replan whose CP-SAT returned NO solution
  within the budget -- those jobs are covered by a deterministic EDD-appended
  fallback plan (re-optimised at the next replan) so execution always completes.

Output: a schedule dict per the interface spec with ``method='rollcp2'``,
``decisions`` = number of replans, ``wall_seconds`` = total wall (solve time
included) and the extra key ``mean_replan_s`` (mean CP-SAT wall per replan).

Determinism (documented residual nondeterminism)
------------------------------------------------
CP-SAT's ``random_seed`` is fixed (0) inside ``cpsat.solve``; technician
tie-order is the sorted technician id; the event heap uses a unique sequence
counter.  Two residual nondeterminism sources remain, both inside CP-SAT:

* *time-budget truncation*: if a snapshot is not proved OPTIMAL within
  ``budget_s`` the incumbent is CP-SAT's best-so-far at the cutoff, which
  varies with machine load;
* *parallel search* (``workers=2``, spec-locked): CP-SAT's workers share
  bounds asynchronously, so even a solve proved OPTIMAL may return a
  *different optimal* schedule run-to-run.

Consequence: the reported WWT is stable whenever snapshots are solved to
optimality (observed on replay instances), but tie-equivalent plans can shift
technician-free times and therefore the arrival-batch boundaries -- so
``decisions`` (replan count), ``mean_replan_s`` and the exact assignment
schedule may vary slightly across runs.  Documented rather than eliminated
(single-worker determinism would deviate from the spec's workers=2 budget).
