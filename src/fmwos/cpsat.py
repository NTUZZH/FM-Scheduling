"""OR-Tools CP-SAT static exact model for the FM work-order scheduling benchmark.

Problem (the interface spec): unrelated parallel machines with trade
eligibility, release dates, weighted tardiness.  Because a technician serves one
trade and eligibility is exact trade-match, the machines are *identical within a
trade*; the model exploits that with a light symmetry break.

Model
-----
Per work order j:
  * one start var s_j and one end var e_j with e_j = s_j + p_j (centi-bh);
  * one assignment BoolVar x[j,u] per eligible technician u, AddExactlyOne;
  * one *optional* interval per eligible technician (presence x[j,u]) that shares
    s_j / e_j -- so a single pair of timing vars serves all its candidate techs;
  * AddNoOverlap over each technician's optional intervals (unary capacity);
  * tardiness T_j >= e_j - due_j, T_j >= 0; minimize sum_j w_j * T_j.

Symmetry break: identical technicians of a trade are ordered so that "used"
machines form a prefix (tech i may be used only if tech i-1 is used).  This is a
valid, objective-preserving break for identical parallel machines.  It is
DISABLED whenever ``tech_available`` is supplied, because per-technician
availability makes the machines no longer interchangeable (a busy technician and
a free one are not symmetric, so a prefix break could cut off the optimum).

warm_start: an existing schedule dict; its assignments become AddHint on the
assignment BoolVars and start vars (a warm start, never a hard constraint).

tech_available (rolling snapshots, the interface spec "Dynamic rolling track"):
an optional ``{tech_id: available_from_bh}`` map.  For each technician u with
``available_from_bh = a_u > 0`` a fixed dummy interval ``[0, a_u)`` (a constant
IntervalVar) is added to u's NoOverlap set, so u cannot process any work order
before ``a_u``.  This models a technician still busy on an in-progress job at the
snapshot instant without changing the schema.  Omitted / None => unchanged
behaviour (backward compatible; the static E1 path never sets it).

Rounding (documented)
---------------------
CP-SAT is integer, so bh are scaled to *centi-bh* (1 bh = 100 units).  To keep
the *reported* schedule feasible under the validator -- which requires
end_bh - start_bh == p_bh within 1e-6 and start_bh >= release_bh -- we report
start_bh on the centi grid but set end_bh = start_bh + p_bh with the *original*
float p_bh (so the duration check is exact).  So that this reported duration can
never create an overlap the model did not reserve, and so a start on the grid is
never earlier than the true release:

  * p_bh      -> ceil(p * 100)      (reserve at least the true processing time)
  * release   -> ceil(release * 100)(grid start >= true release)
  * due       -> round(due * 100)   (objective grid; nearest)

For values that are exact multiples of 0.01 (e.g. the hand-built fixture:
integers and quarter-hours) all three roundings are exact, so the model
objective, the reported schedule's WWT and the validator agree to the bit.  For
arbitrary floats ``objective_bh`` is the model's own (grid) objective and may
differ from the validator's WWT by the sub-centi discretization; both are
reported downstream.
