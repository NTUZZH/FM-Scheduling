"""Permutation-based Genetic Algorithm baseline for the FM work-order
scheduling benchmark.

Problem (the interface spec): identical technicians per trade, all available
from bh 0; exact trade-match eligibility; release dates ``release_bh``; no
preemption; travel = 0; minimise WWT = sum_j w_j * max(0, C_j - due_bh_j).

Locked defaults (docs/protocol.md): population 100, 60 s wall budget, OX (order)
crossover, swap mutation, PDR-seeded initial population.

Representation
--------------
A *genome* is a permutation of all work-order ids.  Internally we use integer
indices ``0..n-1`` that are bijective with the work-order ids (index j <-> the
j-th work order of ``instance["work_orders"]``); an index permutation is exactly
an id permutation and is faster to manipulate.

Decoder (serial schedule generation scheme, gap-aware)
------------------------------------------------------
Walk the permutation left to right.  For each work order, place it on the
*earliest-available* eligible technician.  Because technicians of a trade are
identical, "eligible" is every technician of the WO's trade.  Placement is
**gap-aware**: each technician keeps a time-sorted list of its already-placed
(busy) intervals, and a job is dropped at the earliest feasible point >= its
release_bh -- either an idle GAP between two earlier jobs that is wide enough, or
the tail after the last job.  Across the trade's technicians we take the globally
earliest such start (ties -> lowest technician index).  Since any start is
>= release_bh, the moment a technician offers start == release_bh we stop
scanning (it cannot be beaten), so the common "a free technician exists" case is
O(1); overall the decode is ~O(n * (techs_scanned + gaps_scanned)) with tiny
constants (well under 5 ms for 400 jobs on real instances).

This insertion decoder is strictly stronger than the non-delay PDR dispatcher
(pdrs.py): given the order in which a non-delay schedule starts its jobs, the
decoder can only match or improve every completion time, so it escapes the
"non-delay trap" that costs the PDRs on the tiny fixture (tests/fixtures).

Fitness
-------
WWT of the decoded schedule, computed inline with the exact validator definition
(sum of w_j * max(0, end_j - due_j)).  Lower is better.

Evolutionary loop
-----------------
* Init: the 5 PDR schedules (edd, wspt, atc, pfifo, mor) converted to
  permutations (jobs ordered by start_bh, tie-break wo id), padded to ``pop``
  with random permutations from the seeded RNG.
* Tournament selection (size 3, with replacement).
* OX order crossover -> one child per mating.
* Swap mutation: probability 0.2 per child, a single random transposition.
* Elitism: the best 2 genomes survive unchanged into the next generation.
* Generational replacement to size ``pop``.
* Stop at the wall-clock budget (checked between generations) OR after 200
  generations with no strict improvement of the incumbent.

Determinism
-----------
All genetic operators draw from ``random.Random(seed)`` and are fully
reproducible.  The *number of generations* depends on wall-clock speed, so for a
fixed budget the result may vary slightly across machines; the primary loop is
therefore generation-based and the budget is only checked between generations.
The generations actually completed are reported under the extra key
``"generations"``.

API
---
``solve_ga(instance, budget_s=60.0, seed=301, pop=100) -> schedule dict`` per
the interface spec, with ``method='ga'`` and the extra key ``generations``.
``decisions`` is the number of fitness evaluations (decode calls), for latency
stats consistent with the other baselines.
