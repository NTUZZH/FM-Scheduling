"""Instance-level perturbation transforms for the E5 sensitivity study
(SLA and capacity robustness; docs/protocol.md locked defaults: SLA sweep +-50%,
capacity sweep +-25%).

Two knobs, one transform each, both PURE functions on an instance dict:

* SLA tightness -- ``scale_sla(instance, f)`` shrinks (f < 1) or stretches
  (f > 1) every work order's due window about its release: the slack
  ``due_bh - release_bh`` is multiplied by ``f`` while ``release_bh`` (and the
  priority / weight / processing time) are left untouched.  f in {0.5, 1.5}
  realises the Appendix B +-50% SLA sweep.

* Capacity tightness -- REUSE ``fmwos.tightness.scale_crew(instance, m)`` (no
  new code): it scales every trade's technician count by ``m`` (>= 1 kept),
  m in {0.75, 1.25} realising the Appendix B +-25% capacity sweep.  It is
  re-exported here so the sensitivity runner imports a single module; see
  ``fmwos/tightness.py`` for the implementation and its ``_m<m>`` id suffix.

Both transforms deep-copy their input, annotate ``meta`` with the multiplier and
suffix ``meta.id`` (``_sla<f>`` here; ``_m<m>`` in ``scale_crew``) so a perturbed
instance never collides with the original in an index or a results shard.  The
identity cases -- ``scale_sla(inst, 1.0)`` / ``scale_crew(inst, 1.0)`` -- still
return an annotated deep copy, but the runner represents the (f=1, m=1) baseline
by the untouched base instance itself (no transform, no suffix), so the baseline
id is exactly the base id.
