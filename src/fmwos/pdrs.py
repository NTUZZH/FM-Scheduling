"""Priority dispatching rules (PDRs) for the FM work-order scheduling benchmark.

All rules share one event-driven list-scheduling *dispatcher* (``dispatch``).
The dispatcher builds a **non-delay** schedule: a technician is never left idle
while a released, trade-matching work order is waiting.  This is the standard
list-scheduling protocol for R | elig, r_j | sum w_j T_j and is exactly what the
interface spec asks for -- "when a technician is free and its trade
queue is non-empty, pick the job maximizing the rule's score".

Simulation model
----------------
Two kinds of events, held in a single time-ordered ``heapq``:

  * ``release`` -- a work order becomes available at ``release_bh``;
  * ``free``    -- a technician finishes a job (or is initially free at bh 0).

At each distinct event time we first drain *all* events at that time (so that
every job released at that instant is queued before any pick is made), then, for
each trade whose state changed, we greedily assign queued jobs to idle
technicians of that trade until one side runs out.  Ties between identical
technicians of a trade are broken by technician id (they are interchangeable in
v1, so this never affects the objective, only reproducibility).

The dispatcher never inserts idle time on purpose -- that is the defining
limitation of dispatching versus the CP-SAT solver, and it is *why* a solver can
beat every PDR (see tests/fixtures/tiny_instance.md).

Every choice is deterministic for a fixed ``seed`` (the seed only matters for the
'random' rule).  Complexity: O(E log E) for the event heap plus O(sum |queue|)
for the linear per-dispatch scans; for 400 jobs x dozens of technicians this is
well under a millisecond.

Output: a schedule dict per the interface spec (method = rule name,
``wall_seconds`` measured, ``decisions`` = number of pick decisions = number of
work orders, since every job is picked exactly once).
